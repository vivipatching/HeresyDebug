## A mod for Blasphemous 2

This is a prototype mod for Blasphemous 2, version 1.0.5 (release). Currently, its functionality is limited to an attempted fix for a softlock that rarely occurs after defeating Svsona, Fermosa Fembra. Note that it attempts to lock players out of Yerma's questline bad ending.
